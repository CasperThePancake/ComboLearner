# ComboLearner
A simple, yet useful studying tool.

I made this project to learn JavaScript, along with CSS and HTML. It is the third ever website I ever created, and I'm quite proud of how it turned out. It started with
me wanting to recreate Quizlet, which I think I've managed to get the basics of done.

For now this project is finished, but here are things I'd like to add:
- Numbers next to the list to indicate ID
- Actual test that asks you each term once like Quizlet
